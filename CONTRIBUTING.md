## Development setup

PaperRoute currently targets .NET 10 Windows Forms and is written in Visual Basic .NET.

```powershell
dotnet restore ManuscriptPipeline.slnx
dotnet build ManuscriptPipeline.slnx --configuration Release
```

Before opening a pull request, confirm the solution builds in Release configuration, run the automated test suite, and describe how you tested the change.

```powershell
dotnet test PaperRoute.Tests/PaperRoute.Tests.vbproj --configuration Release --no-build
```

## Data safety

Changes involving persistence, backup/restore, managed files, or import logic should preserve existing local data whenever possible. Avoid silently changing storage locations or destructive behavior without a migration path.

## Style

- Prefer clear, explicit VB.NET over clever compact syntax.
- Keep UI changes DPI-aware.
- Preserve Light/Dark/System theme compatibility.
- Add user-facing validation before destructive actions.
